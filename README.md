# HelpBot

This bot uses Microsoft Bot Framework, which lets this single ASP.NET Web API implementation work for almost any kind of bot ranging from web chat to Facebook Messenger to Skype to SMS (via Twilio).

The bot code supports a demo that illustrates how a bot could be useful in deflecting common Helpdesk / IT Support issues while waiting in the queue for a human IT support technician.

Thanks to Microsoft LUIS, the bot can learn and understand subtly different concepts such as a non-functioning printer versus a request to add a printer.  It can engage in a dialog and reply back with illustrations.
